# DairyBox
<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ludumdare/dairybox/gh-pages/assets/Logo.png">
DairyBox is the Web Development Toolchain for **Jammer** and **Ludum Dare**. To make contributions to the website, you will be using this suite of tools.

### DairyBox Uses
* **Vagrant** - A set of tools for automating and controlling Virtual Machines (VMs)
* **Virtual Box** - for hosting and running those Virtual Machines
* **Scotch/Box** - a flexible preconfigured LAMP VM for Vagrant (Linux+Apache+MySQL+PHP)

The live servers **don't** run LAMP, but instead runs a similar bleeding-edge configuration (Linux+OpenLiteSpeed+MariaDB+PHP7). In the future we may switch to a custom VM that better mirrors what is run on the servers. For details, check out [JuiceBox](https://github.com/povrazor/juicebox).

## What? Explain working with Vagrant and Scotch/Box
The key thing to understand about working with Vagrant boxes (VMs) like Scotch/Box is that Vagrant boxes are temporary. Though you can connect to the Virtual Machine and install whatever you like, Vagrant boxes work best when you install things via setup scripts. That way, they can be *nuked from orbit* whenever you like, giving you fresh/clean install whenever you want one.

In the case of Scotch/Box, the important files (i.e. the website) lives on your local machine. The Scotch/Box VM is pre-configured with a share to those files. You simply edit the files in the `www` folder, refresh your browser to see the changes, and commit/push your changes to your GIT repository once you're happy with them. Easy.

Since the files are NOT on the VM, you can safely `vagrant destroy` whenever you need to update DairyBox.

## I still don't understand
You're running a fake computer on your computer. That fake computer runs Linux. We installed everything for you, and if you break it, you can *push a button* (Vagrant) to get a brand new fake computer. You can destroy and create that fake computer as many times as you want.

Once set up, DairyBox will serve web pages to you. All you have to do is edit files and refresh your browser any time you change something. And if it ever stops working, you can blow up your fake computer using *the button* (Vagrant) and get a new one (though you probably just need to restart it).

We call that editing, clicking, and blowing up computers *the workflow*. 

We call the stuff you download and install *the toolchain*.

## Pre Setup (Part 0)
**ALWAYS** install the latest versions. If something ever stops working, make sure you **are** running the absolute latest version.

1. Install **GIT**: http://git-scm.com/downloads
2. Install **Virtual Box**: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads (***)
3. Install **Vagrant**: http://vagrantup.com/ (***)
4. Install **Vagrant-Exec** and **Vagrant Cachier** plugins:

    ```sh
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-exec
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-cachier
    ```
    
If you're an Ubuntu/Debian user, **DON'T INSTALL VAGRANT AND VIRTUAL BOX USING APT-GET**! The repositories for these are **VERY** out of date. Most Vagrant setup problems on Linux are because you don't have the latest version.

If you're on Arch Linux, you will need the **net-tools** package to make Vagrant work right. See [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Vagrant#No_ping_between_host_and_vagrant_box_.28host-only_networking.29).

If you're on a computer that needs to save hard drive space, **Vagrant Cachier** can be omitted. The plugin is used to keep cached copies of the VM's Ubuntu packages, so you don't need to redownload them.

## Setup Part 1: DairyBox
Clone the **DairyBox** repo. 

**EXAMPLE:**
    
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ludumdare/dairybox.git ludumdare
```
where `ludumdare` is the directory you plan to work out of.
    
**NOTE:** DairyBox is the toolchain. For convenience, we use GIT to download and install it. Most people don't need a Fork of DairyBox. Upgrades are MUCH simpler if you don't.

**DO NOT** do a `vagrant up` yet. We have one more step...

## Setup Part 2: Source
Initialize a new repository in the `www` directory, and set the origin to your source repository.

If you just want to try it out, or don't yet have a GitHub account, you can do the following.

```sh
cd www
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/ludumdare/ludumdare.git
git fetch
git checkout -t origin/master
```

If you do plan to contribute changes, **fork** the `/ludumdare/ludumdare` repostiory, and check it out like so:

```sh 
cd www
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USER-NAME-ON-GIT/ludumdare.git
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ludumdare/ludumdare.git
git fetch
git checkout -t origin/master
```

Or even better, configure SSH, and use `git@github.com:YOUR-USER-NAME-ON-GIT/ludumdare.git` as your origin.

https://help.github.com/categories/ssh/

We will be working in the `www` directory.

## Setup Part 3: Vagrant Up
Do a `vagrant up`.

Setup should take about 4 minutes, but longer on a brand new install (lots of downloading).

After setup, you'll be able to access VM's sandbox folder here: http://192.168.48.48. It may take a moment to connect.

The following domains have been configured to point to the VM running on your local machine:
* http://ludumdare.org - **ludumdare.com** (`www/public-ludumdare.com`)
  * http://api.ludumdare.org - **api.ludumdare.com** (`www/public-api`)
  * http://url.ludumdare.org - **ldj.am** (`www/public-url.shortener`)
* http://jammer.work - **jammer.vg** (`www/public-jammer.vg`)
  * http://api.jammer.work - **api.jammer.vg** (`www/public-api`)
  * http://url.jammer.work - **jam.mr** (`www/public-url.shortener`)
* http://bio.jammer.work - **jammer.bio** (`www/public-jammer.bio`)
  * http://api.bio.jammer.work - **api.jammer.bio** (`www/public-api`)
* http://static.jammer.work - **static.jam.vg** (`www/public-static`)

Testing on remote machines and mobile devices is a bit more effort. See the [Public Server](#public-server) section below.

## Building the Source Code and SVG Assets
There are two ways to build the source code and assets.

1. From inside the VM
2. From outside the VM

Common to both methods is how you build.

* `make` to compile the latest changes to the project
* `make clean` to destroy all files, and start over

### Building inside the VM
This is ready to-go after setup. Simply do the following.

```sh
vagrant ssh
cd ~/www
make
```
This compiles from inside the VM. You can repeat running `make` as many time as you like thereafter.

### Building outside the VM
Building outside the VM requires more setup. The reason you might want to do this is that you get much faster build times outside the VM.

Some of the things you need:

* PHP 7.x with MBString, MySQL, XML, and APCU addons
* Node.js
* GNU Make
* Other image and vidio manipulation command-line tools
* A Unix compatbile environment

#### Ubuntu
Debian setup be similar.

```sh
# Install latest versions of PHP
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ondrej/php
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install php7.0 php7.0-mbstring php7.0-mysql php7.0-xml php-apcu

# Install Image and Video/GIF Manipulation Tools
add-apt-repository -y ppa:mc3man/trusty-media
add-apt-repository -y ppa:jamedjo/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg imagemagick pngquant gifsicle webp

# Install Other Tools
sudo apt-get install make

# Install Node.js (NOTE: You can also install newer versions)
sudo apt-get install nodejs

# Install Node packages (some of these commands may need sudo)
cd www
npm install
npm install -g svgo less clean-css buble rollup uglify-js
```
That should be everything you need to 

Then simply navigate to your version of the `ludumdare/www` folder in bash, and run `make`.

## Merging Upstream
TODO

```sh
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master

git push -u
```

## Upgrading DairyBox
From your root working directory (not `www`).
* Destroy your VM with `vagrant destroy`. This shuts down the server and removes the VM.
* Pull the latest changes with `git pull -u`.
* Update your Vagrant boxes (i.e. Scotch/Box) with `vagrant box update`.
* Initialize a fresh VM with `vagrant up`.

## Tips
You should **suspend** the VM before put it to sleep (or close the lid). If you forget, do a `vagrant suspend` then a `vagrant up` to resume the server.
* `vagrant up` to initialize, start, or resume a server (after suspending or rebooting)
* `vagrant suspend` to put it to sleep
* `vagrant halt` to shut it down (power button)
* `vagrant reload` to restart it
* `vagrant destroy` to delete the VM (the files in www are fine, but everything else is lost)
* `vagrant ssh` to connect to the VM with SSH

## Utilities
### Local Utilities
With **Vagrant-Exec** installed, these shell scripts are available in the Dairybox folder.
* **info.sh** - Get information about the VM. IP addresses, etc.
* **log.sh** - Get the Apache+PHP Log (use PHP function "error_log" to send errors here).

### Config File Symlinks
If you do a `vagrant ssh`, inside your home directory (`~`), you'll find symlinks to configuration files for the various software run on the webserver.
* **~/php.ini** - PHP Configuration
* **~/user.ini** - **OTHER** PHP Configuration. This is the config that enables debugging, etc.
* **~/apache2.conf** - Apache Configuration
* **~/mysql.conf** - MySQL Configuration (NB. file is actually named `my.cnf`, but symlinked with a better name)

Also, for convenience, there are symlinks to the following helpful folders:
* **~/www/** - to the WWW root folder

### Web Utilities
These are some pre-installed tools you can access with your browser. Helpful for debugging.
* http://192.168.48.48/dev/ (`../dev/`)
  * **apcu.php** - Manage APCu state (fast RAM cache) - login: **root**  password: **root**
  * **ocp.php** - Manage Opcache state (PHP Opcache)
  * **phpinfo.php** - Simple script with a phpinfo() call.
  * **phpmyadmin/** - Manage the Databases - login: **root**  password: **root**

Data can be found in the `scotchbox` database.

## Public Server
By default, your DairyBox can only be accessed on the local machine. To access it from another machine or device on your network, you need to enable the Public Server.

To do this, remove the # in front of the `"public_network"` line in your **Vagrantfile** (`/Vagrantfile`).

The next time you start your server with `vagrant up`, you may be prompted which of your Network Interfaces you want to bind (i.e. your Ethernet or your WiFi). For me I choose the ``1`` option, but YMMV.

Once setup completes, you can use the info script to fetch the public IP address of the server.

`./info.sh`

The public IP is usually the IP listed under **eth2**.

The public IP address is needed to connect to the VM remotely. The domains, `jammer.work` and `ludumdare.org` are configured for the default local IP address (`192.168.48.48`), and can't be used for this. You **must** use the IP addresses and **ports** to access the site. Both are detailed above.

Alternatively, you can change the `.hosts` file of your local internet router. For details, go here:

https://github.com/ludumdare/ludumdare/wiki/Testing-on-Mobile

## Enabling OpCache
You should only enable OpCache if you need to better simulate the active **Ludum Dare** server environment, or test OpCache aware features. For most developers, it's preferred that your PHP scripts aren't cached. That way, they reload whenever you refresh your browser.

You can clear the OpCache cache and look-up other details using the OCP tool:

http://192.168.48.48/dev/ocp.php

To Enable OpCache, do the following:

```sh
vagrant ssh
sudo nano ~/user.ini
```

Enable it by changing the `opcache.enable` line like so:

```
opcache.enable=1
```

Save and close the file (`CTRL+O, ENTER, CTRL+X`). Restart Apache.

```sh
sudo service apache2 restart
```

## Configuring APCu (Memory Cache)
APCu comes pre-configured in DairyBox.

The **Ludum Dare** website requires APCu. APCu is faster than Memcached (shared data is written directly to RAM instead of being piped over TCP), but is unreliable when it comes to scaling across multiple servers. Data that must be real-time accurate across multiple servers should not be cached by APCu. That said, a lot of **Ludum Dare** data can safely be wrong and out of date. For example: Changes to data **must** be read and written to the database, but data fetched by users browsing the website (comments, posts, likes, links, etc) can safely be out-of-date. In practice, the worst case has data out-of-date for a few minutes, but in many cases it wont even be a second.

**NOTE**: APCu for PHP 7.0 may be less fragile, but we currently run PHP 5.6 on the VM.

For caching advice, see the Development Guide.

You can check what's cached and how much memory is used with the ACPu tool:

http://192.168.48.48/dev/apcu.php

To change setting (memory usage, etc), do edit `php.ini`:

TODO: Add a file in conf.d instead of doing things to php.ini

## Configuring e-mail for testing

Run the shell script `~/start_mailcatcher.sh`.

This starts Mailcatcher on Port 1080.

http://192.168.48.48:1080/

Any emails generated by the server will be caught and displayed inside Mailcatcher.

## Testing legacy Internet Explorer versions

Microsoft offers a variety of Virtual Machines for testing Internet Explorer 8-11 on Windows 7 and 8, as well as Microsoft Edge on Windows 10. The toolchain is already using VirtualBox, so it makes sense to grab VirtualBox images.

https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/

Unzip the downloads, and double click the `.ova` files to install them in VirtualBox.

Windows XP and Vista VM downloads are no longer officially available (with IE7 and IE8), but can be downloaded here:

https://github.com/magnetikonline/linuxmicrosoftievirtualmachines#ie8---xp

**NOTE**: Be sure to snapshot the VMs **BEFORE** starting them for the first time. The VMs use un-activated versions of Windows, and will expire after 30-90 days. With a snapshot, you can roll-back the VM and get a new 30-90 days.
